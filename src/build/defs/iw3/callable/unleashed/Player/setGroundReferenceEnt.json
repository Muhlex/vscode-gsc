	"description": [
		"The ground entity's rotation will be added onto the player's view. In particular, this will cause tha player's yaw to rotate around the entity's z-axis instead of the world z-axis. You only need to call this function once. After that, any rotation that the reference entity undergoes will affect the player. Setting it back to 0 (worldspawn) should disable all further effects."
